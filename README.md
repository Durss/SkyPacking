# SkyPacking
Small tool to help playing an old game.  
In that game there were island with limited place and random shapes in which we could place buildings of either 1x1 cell or 2x2. 
This tool helped optimizing placement of building on this island to place the maximum 2x2 buildings on it (which were the most important)
